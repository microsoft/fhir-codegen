Sometimes referred to as &quot;bench to bedside&quot;, which is the iterative feedback loop between healthcare research and clinical trials with input from information collected in the course of routine provision of healthcare. For example, by extending a patient encounter to conduct a survey related to a research topic such as attitudes about use of a wellness device that a patient agreed to use. May be used in combination with clinical trial and other healthcare research purposes of use.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>4</td>\n                <td>      PATRQT\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-PATRQT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>patient requested</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information in response to a patient's request.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>5</td>\n                <td>        FAMRQT\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-FAMRQT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>family requested</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information in response to a request by a family member authorized by the patient.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>5</td>\n                <td>        PWATRNY\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-PWATRNY\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>power of attorney</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information in response to a request by a person appointed as the patient's legal representative.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>5</td>\n                <td>        SUPNWK\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-SUPNWK\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>support network</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information in response to a request by a person authorized by the patient.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>4</td>\n                <td>      PUBHLTH\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-PUBHLTH\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>public health</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information for conducting public health activities, such as the reporting of notifiable conditions.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>5</td>\n                <td>        DISASTER\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-DISASTER\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>disaster</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information used for provision of immediately needed health care to a population of living subjects located in a disaster zone.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>5</td>\n                <td>        THREAT\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-THREAT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>threat</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information used to prevent injury or disease to living subjects who may be the target of violence. \n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>4</td>\n                <td>      TREAT\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-TREAT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>treatment</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more operations on information for provision of health care. \n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>5</td>\n                <td>        CLINTRL\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-CLINTRL\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>clinical trial</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform health care as part of the clinical trial protocol.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>5</td>\n                <td>        COC\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActReason-COC\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>coordination of care</td>\n                <td>\n                        To perform one or more actions on information in order to organize the provision and case management of an individualâ€™s healthcare, including: Monitoring a person's goals, needs, and preferences;
