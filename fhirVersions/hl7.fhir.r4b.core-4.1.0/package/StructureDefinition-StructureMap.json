Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.\n\nModifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).\">modifierExtension</a></td></tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: #F7F7F7\"><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAACCAYAAACg/LjIAAAALUlEQVR4Xu3IoREAIAwEwfT6/ddA0GBAxO3NrLlKUj9263wAAAAvrgEAADClAVWFQIBRHMicAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\" class=\"hierarchy\"><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAAWCAYAAAABxvaqAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAB3RJTUUH3wYeFzIs1vtcMQAAAB1pVFh0Q29tbWVudAAAAAAAQ3JlYXRlZCB3aXRoIEdJTVBkLmUHAAAAE0lEQVQI12P4//8/AxMDAwNdCABMPwMo2ctnoQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: inherit\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAWCAYAAADJqhx8AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAB3RJTUUH3wYeFzI3XJ6V3QAAAB1pVFh0Q29tbWVudAAAAAAAQ3JlYXRlZCB3aXRoIEdJTVBkLmUHAAAANklEQVQ4y+2RsQ0AIAzDav7/2VzQwoCY4iWbZSmo1QGoUgNMghvWaIejPQW/CrrNCylIwcOCDYfLNRcNer4SAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: inherit\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAARklEQVQ4y2P8//8/AyWAhYFCMAgMuHjx4n+KXaCv+I0szW8WpCG8kFO1lGFKW/SIjAUYgxz/MzAwMDC+nqhDUTQyjuYFBgCNmhP4OvTRgwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: #F7F7F7; background-color: inherit\" title=\"Primitive Data Type\" class=\"hierarchy\"/> <span title=\"StructureMap.url : An absolute URI that is used to identify this structure map when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical identifier.
