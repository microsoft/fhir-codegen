Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta, without response.  It is felt by OO that the best course of action to take at this time is to add this comprehensive Open Issue rather than deprecate these three concepts at this time, until further discussion is held.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr style=\"background: #EFEFEF\">\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>HM\n                  <a name=\"v3-ObservationInterpretation-HM\"> </a> \n                  <b>\n                    <i>Deprecated</i>\n                  </b>\n                </td>\n                <td>Hold for Medical Review</td>\n                <td>\n                        Hold for Medical Review\n                  <br/>\n\n                        \n                           Usage Note: This code is not intended for use in V3 artifacts.
