# fhir-codegen

A .Net library and related utilities to work with FHIR specifications.

# Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found on the [documentation site](https://microsoft.github.io/fhir-codegen/).

# Projects in this Repository

Project source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-codegen).

All projects are currently built on .Net 6.0 and tested on multiple platforms, though Windows is the primary development platform.  The .Net 6.0 SDK and runtimes are available for free at: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download .

## Microsoft.Health.Fhir.CodeGenCommon

This project is a class library that contains the common (normalized) models used in these projects.  The project is lightweight and used to ensure that additional projects (e.g., a WASM UI) have access to all the models.

Detailed information about the models can be found in the [Common Models Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/fhir-codegen/api/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.CodeGenCommon.Models.html).

## Microsoft.Health.Fhir.SpecManager

This project is a class library that contains the logic used in the various projects.  For example, this project contains the code to:
* download packages,
* resolve canonical URLs,
* normalize different versions of FHIR,
* read metadata (CapabilityStatement or Conformance) from FHIR servers,
* compare packages or artifacts,
* convert normalized models into language-specific models,
* etc.

More information about this project can be found in the [API Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/fhir-codegen/api/index.html).

### Export Languages

The projects in this repository can be used to translate FHIR packages (core or IG) into other forms - e.g., programming language definitions (C#, TypeScript, etc.), or data files for consumption (Info, Cytoscape, etc.).

More information about current languages can be found on the [Export Languages Page](https://microsoft.github.io/fhir-codegen/articles/languages.html).  Information about adding new languages can be found on the [Extending Page](https://microsoft.github.io/fhir-codegen/articles/extending.html).


## FhirCodeGenBlazor

This project is a server-side Blazor application that can be used to interact with the code-generation library.  Generally, it can:
* manage the FHIR Package Cache (`~/.fhir`) - add/update/remove packages
* browse package artifacts
* search across element information (e.g., resource/logical models elements)
* compare packages or artifacts (Diff Tool)
* perform exports
* etc.

To run this project from a command line:
* `dotnet run --project src/FhirCodeGenBlazor/FhirCodeGenBlazor.csproj`
or, you can build a release version to run:
* `dotnet build src/FhirCodeGenBlazor/FhirCodeGenBlazor.csproj -c Release`
* `dotnet ./src/FhirCodeGenBlazor/bin/Release/net6.0/FhirCodeGenBlazor.dll`

More information about this project can be found in the [API Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/fhir-codegen/api/index.html).

More information about this project can be found in the [Blazor UI Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/fhir-codegen/articles/blazorui.html).


## fhir-codegen-cli

### Examples

* Download and parse FHIR R4 (latest published version) into the user FHIR cache, then build a TypeScript file in the current directory
  * `fhir-codegen-cli -p hl7.fhir.r4#latest --language TypeScript --output-path ./R4.ts`

* Download and parse FHIR R4 (latest published version) into the user FHIR cache, then build a TypeScript file in the current directory, restricted to just the Resources: Patient, Encounter, and Observation
  * `fhir-codegen-cli --load-r4 latest --language TypeScript --output-path ./R4.ts --export-keys Patient|Encounter|Observation`

* Download and parse the latest published version of each FHIR release into the user FHIR cache, then build a C# file for each in ./cs
  * `fhir-codegen-cli --load-r2 latest --load-r3 latest --load-r4 latest --load-r5 latest --language CSharpBasic --output-path ./cs`

* Download and parse FHIR R4 (latest published version) into the user FHIR cache, then build a C# file in the current directory using the namespace: MyOrg.MyProject.Fhir
  * `fhir-codegen-cli -p hl7.fhir.r4#latest --language CSharpBasic --output-path ./cs/R4.cs --language-options CSharpBasic|namespace=MyOrg.MyProject.Fhir`

## fhir-codegen-test-cli

This project is a **minimal** test harness for generated TypeScript and CSharp code.  It can be used to ensure that the core parsing and generation is working properly, and potentially as an example for other language outputs.

To run this project from a command line:
* `dotnet run --project src/fhir-codegen-test-cli/fhir-codegen-test-cli.csproj -- [options]`

It will use generated CSharpBasic and TypeScript files for FHIR Versions DSTU2, STU3, R4, and R5.  It will then run each through a build process (requires `dotnet` for C# and `tsc` for TypeScript) to validate there are no syntax errors in any of the generated files.

Note that this test takes several minutes to run.

## Usage
```
fhir-codegen-test-cli:
  The FHIR CodeGen Test CLI.

Usage:
  fhir-codegen-test-cli [options]

Options:
  --repo-root-path <repo-root-path>    The path to the repository root (if not CWD).
  --verbose                            True to display all output (default: false)
  --fixed-format-statistics            True to output *only* test run statistics:
                                         #run[tab]#passed[tab]#failed[tab]#skipped
                                         (default: false)
  --errors-to-std-error                True to write errors to stderr instead of stdout.
                                         (default: False)
  --version                            Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                       Show help and usage information
```

## Requirements

In order to run TypeScript tests, the system must be able to find the 'tsc' (TypeScript compile) command.  Note that it must be installed and accessible by the test application (e.g., `npm install -g typescript`).

## fhirCsR2

This is a library project used to isolate the FHIR DSTU2 definitions.  All other versions of FHIR are dynamically parsed, but there has not been justification to port this forward - no technical corrections for DSTU2 are expected, so this is *mostly* considered legacy.

# Pre-Generated Files

The `generated` directory has static outputs for each of the supported versions of FHIR, in some of the supported languages.  These files are used to validate changes to the core loading and parsing, but may be useful otherwise.

# Build and Running From OCI (i.e. Docker) Images

If you do not have .NET installed and wish to use the command-line utilities, you may instead build an OCI container to run it for you. The included [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) has been tested with Docker Desktop but should work also with `buildah` and container runtimes such as `podman` and `cri-o`. To build your own image for your native CPU architecture:

  `docker build -t <whatever>/fhir-codegen:latest .`

Alternatively, to build and push for multiple CPU architectures,

  `docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 --push -t <whatever>/fhir-codegen:latest .`

The image is configured to run the CLI as its default entry point. To generate FHIR 4.0.1 TypeScript interfaces to a file on your _host_ computer's ./out directory, for example, simply pass the arguments as input to the container runtime, like so:

  ``docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`/out:/out <whatever>/fhir-codegen:latest --load-r4 4.0.1 --language TypeScript --output-path /out``

The above command binds an ./out directory (within your current working directory) to the output directory of fhir-codegen-cli running within the container, so you output will persist after the container exits and is removed.
