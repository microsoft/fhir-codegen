Examples: Physically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale: Particularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue: There needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies.","codeSystem":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-oid","valueUri":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.5.1064"}],"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","caseSensitive":true,"concept":[{"code":"ELECTRONIC","abstract":false,"display":"electronic data","definition":"Participation by non-human-languaged based electronic signal"},{"code":"PHYSICAL","abstract":false,"display":"physical presence","definition":"Participation by direct action where subject and actor are in the same location.
