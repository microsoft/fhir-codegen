This code set is based on current federal standards for classifying data on race and ethnicity, specifically the minimum race and ethnicity categories defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and a more detailed set of race and ethnicity categories maintained by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (BC). The main purpose of the code set is to facilitate use of federal standards for classifying data on race and ethnicity when these data are exchanged, stored, retrieved, or analyzed in electronic form. At the same time, the code set can be applied to paper-based record systems to the extent that these systems are used to collect, maintain, and report data on race and ethnicity in accordance with current federal standards.</td>\n                <td>added v2.7, removed after v2.8.2</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>CDS\n                  <a name=\"CDS\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>CDC Surveillance</td>\n                <td>CDC Surveillance Codes.

ICD-O is used in cancer registries (and other related areas) for coding the topography (site) and morphology of a neoplasm. The topography code uses similar categories as ICD-10 for malignant neoplasms allowing greater specificity for the site of non-malignant neoplasms than in ICD-10.  The topography code consists of an alphabetic character (the letter C) followed by two numeric digits, a decimal point, and a numeric digit. The morphology code consists of a 6-digit numeric code which consists of three parts: histologic type (4-digit), behavior code (1-digit), and grading or differentiation (1-digit). ICD-O-2 is used for tumors diagnosed prior to 2001.</td>\n                <td>added v2.7, removed after v2.8.2</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>ICDO3\n                  <a name=\"ICDO3\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>International Classification of Disease for Oncology Third Edition</td>\n                <td>Fritz A, Percy C, Jack A, Shanmugaratnam K, Sobin L, Parkin D, et al, editors.

NDCs (National Drug Codes) for specific drug products (where there are often many NDC codes for a single product) are linked to that product in RxNorm. RxNorm links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software, including those of First Databank, Micromedex, MediSpan, and Multum. By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.RxNorm is one of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information.</td>\n                <td>added v2.7, removed after v2.8.2</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>SCT\n                  <a name=\"SCT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>SNOMED Clinical Terms</td>\n                <td>SNOMED-CT concept identifier codes.\nSNOMED International, I325 Waukegan Rd, Northfield, IL, 60093, +1 800-323-4040, mailto:snomed@cap.org  http://www.snomed.org</td>\n                <td>added v2.6, removed after v2.8.2</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>SCT2\n                  <a name=\"SCT2\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>SNOMED Clinical Terms alphanumeric codes</td>\n                <td>Used to indicate that the code value is the legacy-style SNOMED alphanumeric codes, rather than the concept identifier codes.\nSNOMED International, I325 Waukegan Rd, Northfield, IL, 60093, +1 800-323-4040, mailto:snomed@cap.org  http://www.snomed.org</td>\n                <td>added v2.6, removed after v2.8.2</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>SDM\n                  <a name=\"SDM\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>SNOMED- DICOM Microglossary</td>\n                <td>College of American Pathologists, Skokie, IL, 60077-1034.
