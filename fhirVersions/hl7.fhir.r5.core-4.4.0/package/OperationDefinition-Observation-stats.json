This operation evaluates [Observation](observation.html) resources having valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes. Observations with a status of 'entered-in-error' will be excluded from the calculations.  \r\rThe set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters:\r\r*  the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)\r* which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and `system`, or `coding`)\r* the time period over which to generate statistics 'duration` or `period`)\r* the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`)\r\rPossible statistical analyses (see [StatisticsCode](valueset-observation-statistics.html)):\r\r - **average** (\"Average\"): The [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **maximum** (\"Maximum\"): The [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **minimum** (\"Minimum\"): The [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **count** (\"Count\"): The [number] of valid measurements over the stated period that contributed to the other statistical outputs.\r\n - **total-count** (\"Total Count\"): The total [number] of valid measurements over the stated period, including observations that were ignored because they did not contain valid result values.\r\n - **median** (\"Median\"): The [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **std-dev** (\"Standard Deviation\"): The [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **sum** (\"Sum\"): The [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **variance** (\"Variance\"): The [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **20-percent** (\"20th Percentile\"): The 20th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **80-percent** (\"80th Percentile\"): The 80th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **4-lower** (\"Lower Quartile\"): The lower [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **4-upper** (\"Upper Quartile\"): The upper [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **4-dev** (\"Quartile Deviation\"): The difference between the upper and lower [Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) is called the Interquartile range. (IQR = Q3-Q1) Quartile deviation or Semi-interquartile range is one-half the difference between the first and the third quartiles.\r\n - **5-1** (\"1st Quintile\"): The lowest of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **5-2** (\"2nd Quintile\"): The second of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **5-3** (\"3rd Quintile\"): The third of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **5-4** (\"4th Quintile\"): The fourth of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **skew** (\"Skew\"): Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or even undefined.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness).\r\n - **kurtosis** (\"Kurtosis\"): Kurtosis  is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.   Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis).\r\n - **regression** (\"Regression\"): Linear regression is an approach for modeling two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables.
