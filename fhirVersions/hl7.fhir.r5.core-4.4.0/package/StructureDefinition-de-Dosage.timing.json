Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Dosage.timing","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"Timing"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":".effectiveTime"}]}]}}
