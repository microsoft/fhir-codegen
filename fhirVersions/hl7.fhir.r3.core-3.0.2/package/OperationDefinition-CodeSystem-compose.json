In this mode, the server returns a list of complete, possible or partial matches (possibly with comments), so that the user can choose (or not) the most appropriate code\n* By a machine (typically in a system interface performing a transformation). In this mode, the server returns only a list of complete and partial matches, but no possible matches. The machine can choose a code from the list (or not) based on what properties are not coded\n\nThese modes are differentiated by the 'exact' parameter, so the client can indicate whether it only wants exact matches (including partial matches) or whether potential matches based on text matching are desired\n \nThe compose operation is still preliminary. The interface can be expected to change as more experience is gained from implementations.","code":"compose","resource":["CodeSystem"],"system":false,"type":true,"instance":true,"parameter":[{"name":"system","use":"in","min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"The system in which composition is to be performed.
