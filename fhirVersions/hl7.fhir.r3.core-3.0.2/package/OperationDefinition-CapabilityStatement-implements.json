It merely checks that the behaviors the client wishes to use are provided\n\nTechnically, this operation is implemented as follows:\n * The server's capability statement must have an entry for each resource in the client's capability statement \n * The servers' resource support must have matching flags for updateCreate, conditionalCreate, conditionalRead, conditionalUpdate, conditionalDelete, searchInclude, searchRevInclude\n * The server capability statement must have a matching interaction for each interaction in the client capability statement (whether or not it is on a resource)\n * The server must have a search parameter with matching name and definition for any search parameters in the client capability statement\n * The server must have an operation definitions with a matching reference for any operations in the client capability statement\n\nIf the capability statements match by these rules, then the return value is a 200 OK with an operation outcome that contains no issues with severity >= error. If the capability statement doesn't match, the return value is a 4xx error, with an OperationOutcome with at least one issue with severity >= error","resource":["CapabilityStatement"],"system":false,"type":true,"instance":true,"parameter":[{"name":"server","use":"in","min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"The canonical URL for the server capability statement - use this if the implements is not invoked on an instance (or on the /metadata end-point)","type":"uri"},{"name":"client","use":"in","min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"The canonical URL for the client capability statement - use this if the implements is not invoked on an instance (or on the /metadata end-point)","type":"uri"},{"name":"resource","use":"in","min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"The client capability statement, provided inline","type":"CapabilityStatement"},{"name":"return","use":"out","min":1,"max":"1","documentation":"Outcome of the CapabilityStatement test","type":"OperationOutcome"}]}
