The original document shall be referenced via an attribute in the new document, which contains, for example, the digest of the old document.

This signature is reserved for the highest health information system administrative classification, since it is a statement that the entire document is invalidated by the error and that the document should no longer be used for patient care, although for legal reasons the document must remain part of the permanent patient record."}]}}
