Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.","comments":"There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","alias":["extensions","user content","modifiers"],"min":0,"max":"*","base":{"path":"Goal.outcome.modifierExtension","min":0,"max":"*"},"type":[{"code":"Extension"}],"isModifier":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A"}]},{"path":"Goal.outcome.result[x]","short":"Code or observation that resulted from goal","definition":"Details of what\u0027s changed (or not changed).","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"Goal.outcome.result[x]","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation"]}],"binding":{"strength":"example","description":"The result of the goal; e.g. \"25% increase in shoulder mobility\", \"Anxiety reduced to moderate levels\".  \"15 kg weight loss sustained over 6 months\""}}]},"differential":{"element":[{"path":"Goal","name":"QICore-Goal","min":0,"max":"*","type":[{"code":"Goal"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"qdm","map":"Care Goal"}]},{"path":"Goal.extension","name":"Goal.target","slicing":{"discriminator":["url"],"ordered":false,"rules":"open"},"min":0,"max":"*","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/goal-target"]}],"mustSupport":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"qdm","map":"target outcome"}]},{"path":"Goal.extension.extension","name":"Goal.target.measure","slicing":{"discriminator":["url"],"ordered":false,"rules":"open"},"min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/goal-target#measure"]}],"binding":{"strength":"preferred","description":"LOINC codes","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/uslab-obs-codes"}}},{"path":"Goal.extension.extension","name":"Goal.target.detail","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/goal-target#detail"]}],"binding":{"strength":"preferred","description":"SNOMED CT for coded results","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/uslab-obs-codedresults"}}},{"path":"Goal.extension","name":"Goal.reasonRejected","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/goal-reasonRejected"]}],"binding":{"strength":"example","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/qicore-goal-reason-rejected"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"qdm","map":"negation rationale"}]},{"path":"Goal.subject","type":[{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/qicore-patient"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Group"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/qicore-organization"]}],"mustSupport":true},{"path":"Goal.targetDate","mustSupport":true},{"path":"Goal.category","mustSupport":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"qdm","map":"primary code"}]},{"path":"Goal.status","mustSupport":true},{"path":"Goal.statusDate","mustSupport":true},{"path":"Goal.addresses","type":[{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/qicore-condition"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/qicore-observation"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/qicore-medicationstatement"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/NutritionOrder"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/qicore-procedurerequest"]},{"code":"Reference","profile":["http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/RiskAssessment"]}],"mustSupport":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"qdm","map":"related to"}]}]}}
