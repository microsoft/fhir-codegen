Examples:\r\nPhysically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:\r\nParticularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:\r\nThere needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies.","caseSensitive":true,"valueSet":"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ParticipationMode","hierarchyMeaning":"is-a","content":"complete","concept":[{"code":"ELECTRONIC","display":"electronic data","definition":"Participation by non-human-languaged based electronic signal"},{"code":"PHYSICAL","display":"physical presence","definition":"Participation by direct action where subject and actor are in the same location.
