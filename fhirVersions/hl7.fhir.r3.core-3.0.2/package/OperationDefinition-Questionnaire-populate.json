If called at the instance level, these parameters will be ignored.\n\nThe response will contain a [QuestionnaireResponse](questionnaireresponse.html) instance based on the specified [Questionnaire](questionnaire.html) and/or an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) resource with errors or warnings.\n\nThe [QuestionnaireResponse](questionnaireresponse.html) instance will be populated with an unanswered set of questions following the group and question structure of the specified [Questionnaire](questionnaire.html).  If  *content* parameters were specified or the *local* parameter was set to true, some of the questions may have answers filled in as well.  In the case of repeating questions or groups, typically only one repetition will be provided unless answer values exist that would support populating multiple repetitions.\n\nPopulation of the [QuestionnaireResponse](questionnaireresponse.html) with appropriate data is dependent on the questions and/or groups in the [Questionnaire](questionnaire.html) having metadata that allows the server to recognize the questions, e.g. through Questionnaire.item.definition or through use of the [ConceptMap](conceptmap.html) resource.\n\nRegardless of the mechanism used to link the questions in a questionnaire to a \"known\" mappable concept, solutions using this operation should ensure that the details of the question and associated linkage element are sufficiently similar as to safely allow auto-population; i.e. the question text and context must be sufficiently the same, the value set for the question must fall within the value set for the mapped element, the data types must be the same or convertible, etc.","code":"populate","comment":"While it is theoretically possible for a [QuestionnaireResponse](questionnaireresponse.html) instance to be completely auto-populated and submitted without human review, the intention of this transaction is merely to reduce redundant data entry.  A client **SHOULD** ensure that a human submitter has an opportunity to review the auto-populated answers to confirm correctness as well as to complete or expand on information provided by the auto-population process.\n\nWhen creating an \"empty\" questionnaire, the general algorithm is to create a QuestionnaireResponse with one item for every item in the source Questionnaire, including items with \"enableWhen\", \"display\" items, etc.  If a question has a default, the default answer should be populated.  And the QuestionnaireResponse should point back to the originating Questionnaire.  Repeating items will typically only include a single repetition.  Other extensions and/or elements may also be populated if the system is aware of appropriate values.\n\nComplex form designs with conditional logic or tight constraints on cardinalities may be challenging to auto-populate.  A server MAY choose to traverse the questionnaire as if it were a human respondent, answering only those questions that are enabled based on previously answered questions.  However, doing so may result in minimal population.  Alternatively, systems may choose to populate all known answers, independent of dependencies and other constraints.  This may cause questions to be answered that should not be answered.  It will be up to the client to appropriately prune the final populated questionnaire once human review has taken place.\n\nInvoking this operation with the ''content'' parameter may involve the disclosure of personally identifiable healthcare information to the system which is performing the population process.  No such disclosures should be made unless the system on which the operation is being invoked is a \"trusted\" system and appropriate agreements are in place to protect the confidentiality of any information shared with that system.","resource":["Questionnaire"],"system":false,"type":true,"instance":true,"parameter":[{"name":"identifier","use":"in","min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"A logical questionnaire identifier (i.e. ''Questionnaire.identifier'').
