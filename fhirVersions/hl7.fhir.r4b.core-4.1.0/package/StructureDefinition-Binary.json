Given that the Binary resource contains very few elements that can be used to determine the sensitivity of the data and relationships to individuals, the referenced resource stands in as a proxy equivalent for this purpose. This referenced resource may be related to the Binary (e.g. Media, DocumentReference), or may be some non-related Resource purely as a security proxy. E.g. to identify that the binary resource relates to a patient, and access should only be granted to applications that have access to the patient.\">securityContext</span><a name=\"Binary.securityContext\"> </a></td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\"><a style=\"padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px; color: black; null\" href=\"elementdefinition-definitions.html#ElementDefinition.isSummary\" title=\"This element is included in summaries\">Σ</a></td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\">0..1</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\"><a href=\"references.html#Reference\">Reference</a>(<a href=\"resourcelist.html\">Any</a>)</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: white; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\">Identifies another resource to use as proxy when enforcing access control</td></tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: #F7F7F7\"><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAACCAYAAACg/LjIAAAAJUlEQVR4Xu3IIQEAAAgDsHd9/w4EQIOamFnaBgAA4MMKAACAKwNp30CqZFfFmwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\" class=\"hierarchy\"><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAAWCAYAAAABxvaqAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAB3RJTUUH3wYeFzIs1vtcMQAAAB1pVFh0Q29tbWVudAAAAAAAQ3JlYXRlZCB3aXRoIEdJTVBkLmUHAAAAE0lEQVQI12P4//8/AxMDAwNdCABMPwMo2ctnoQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: inherit\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAWCAYAAADJqhx8AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAB3RJTUUH3wYeFzME+lXFigAAAB1pVFh0Q29tbWVudAAAAAAAQ3JlYXRlZCB3aXRoIEdJTVBkLmUHAAAANklEQVQ4y+3OsRUAIAjEUOL+O8cJABttJM11/x1qZAGqRBEVcNIqdWj1efDqQbb3HwwwwEfABmQUHSPM9dtDAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: inherit\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAARklEQVQ4y2P8//8/AyWAhYFCMAgMuHjx4n+KXaCv+I0szW8WpCG8kFO1lGFKW/SIjAUYgxz/MzAwMDC+nqhDUTQyjuYFBgCNmhP4OvTRgwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: #F7F7F7; background-color: inherit\" title=\"Primitive Data Type\" class=\"hierarchy\"/> <span title=\"Binary.data : The actual content, base64 encoded.\">data</span><a name=\"Binary.data\"> </a></td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\">0..1</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\"><a href=\"datatypes.html#base64Binary\">base64Binary</a></td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\">The actual content</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td colspan=\"5\" class=\"hierarchy\"><br/><a href=\"formats.html#table\" title=\"Legend for this format\"><img src=\"help16.png\" alt=\"doco\" style=\"background-color: inherit\"/> Documentation for this format</a></td></tr></table></div>","status":"generated"},"type":"Binary","url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Binary","version":"4.1.0"}
