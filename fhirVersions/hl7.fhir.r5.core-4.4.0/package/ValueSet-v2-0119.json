One or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of PA are followed by one or more ORC segments with an ORC-1-order control value of CH. Whether OBR segments must be present is determined by the value of ORC-6-response flag. \n\nFor example, suppose that a microbiology culture produced two organisms and corresponding susceptibility reports. Then the sequence of segments would be as follows: (see figure 4-4)\n\nThe assignment of placer order numbers in the parent-child paradigm depends on whether the placer or filler creates the child order and in the latter case, on whether the placer supports the SN/NA transaction. If the placer creates the child orders it will assign their placer order numbers according to its usual procedures. If the filler creates the child orders there are two possibilities: each child will inherit the placer order number of its parent, or the filler will use the SN/NA transaction to request that the placer assign a placer order number. In either case, the filler application creates the filler order numbers of the children according to its usual procedures.\n\nWhenever a child order is transmitted in a message the ORC segment’s ORC-8-parent is valued with the parent’s filler order number (if originating from the filler) and with the parent’s placer order number (if originating from the filler or if originating from the placer). \n\nThe parent child mechanism can be used to “expand” a parent order (e.g., an order for three EKGs on successive mornings).</td>\n                <td>from v2.1</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>PR\n                  <a name=\"PR\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Previous Results with new order/service</td>\n                <td>Placer Applications.\nPR indicates that this ORC is part of an ORU structure containing previous observation, which is embedded in the order.\n\nAt least two main use cases require that the complete results of the previous observations be transmitted with the order. \n\n•\tDiagnostic laboratories referring tests to another lab for either confirmation of results (HIV, etc.) or due to not being equipped to do the tests (genetic testing, etc.). \n\n•\tDiagnostic laboratories sending test results to Knowledge Bases for the automated generation of diagnostic comments for inclusion into the lab report.</td>\n                <td>added v2.4</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>PY\n                  <a name=\"PY\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Notification of replacement order for outside dispense</td>\n                <td>Placer Applications.\nSee comments for OP - Notification of order for outside dispense.</td>\n                <td>added v2.5</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>RA\n                  <a name=\"RA\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Recommendation Accepted</td>\n                <td/>\n                <td>added v2.9</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>RC\n                  <a name=\"RC\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Recommended Change</td>\n                <td/>\n                <td>added v2.9</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>RD\n                  <a name=\"RD\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Recommendation Declined</td>\n                <td/>\n                <td>added v2.9</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>RE\n                  <a name=\"RE\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Observations/Performed Service to follow</td>\n                <td>Placer or Filler Applications.\nThe observations-to-follow code is used to transmit patient-specific information with an order. An order detail segment (e.g., OBR) can be followed by one or more observation segments (OBX). Any observation that can be transmitted in an ORU message can be transmitted with this mechanism. When results are transmitted with an order, the results should immediately follow the order or orders that they support.\n\nThe following example shows the sequence of segments for three Pharmacy orders. It illustrates the use of the RE code:\nSegment\tOrder Control\tComment\nMSH\t\t\nPID\t\t\nORC\tNW\tFirst new order\nRXO\t\tFirst order segment\n\t\t\nORC\tNW\t2nd new order\nRXO\t\t2nd order segment\n[ORC\tRE\tPatient-specific observation, optional in V 2.2\n OBR]\t\tObservation OBR, optional in V 2.2\nOBX\t\tAn observation segment\nOBX\t\tAnother observation segment\nOBX\t\tAnother observation segment\nOBX\t\tAnother observation segment\n\t\t\nORC\tNW\t3rd order\nRXO\t\t3rd order segment\n\nIn this version of HL7, results can be transmitted with an order as one or more OBX segments without the necessity of including the ORC and OBR segments.\n\nObservations can be transmitted in an ORU message without using an ORC. There are times when it is necessary to transmit information not included in the OBR segments of the ORU message. In this case, it is recommended that the ORC be included in the ORU message.\n\nThe order control value of RE is required only in ORM messages to indicate that an order is followed by observation results (OBX). The RE code is not necessary in the ORU message because it is expected that the OBR segments can be followed by observation results (OBX).</td>\n                <td>from v2.1</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>RF\n                  <a name=\"RF\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Refill order/service request</td>\n                <td>Placer or Filler Applications.\nRF accommodates requests by either the filler or the placer. The filler may be requesting refill authorization from the placer. A placer system may be requesting a refill to be done by the filler system.\n\nTypical responses include, but are not limited to: For a Filler request AF – Order/service refill request approval, DF – Order/service refill request denied; for a Placer request RE – Observations/Performed Service to follow, UF – Unable to refill.</td>\n                <td>added v2.3</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>RL\n                  <a name=\"RL\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Release previous hold</td>\n                <td>Placer Applications.</td>\n                <td>added v2.2</td>\n              </tr>\n              <tr>\n                <td>RO\n                  <a name=\"RO\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>Replacement order</td>\n                <td>Placer or Filler Applications.\nA replacement is the substitution of one or more orders for one or more previously ordered services.\n\nThe replaced orders are treated as though they were canceled. If and when an ordered service can be replaced are local site-specific determinations.\n\nUse the parent/child order control codes if the site specifies that the original order must remain intact. Do not use the replacement codes under this circumstance. \n\nFor each order to be replaced, use an ORC-1-order control value of RP (request for a replacement going to a filler) or RU (an unsolicited replacement created by the filler) used by the filler to notify the placer and/or other systems). By local agreement, the ORC segment (with RP or RU) may be followed by its original order detail segment. The ORC segments (with RP or RU) must be followed by an ORC segment with an ORC-1-order control value of RO (indicating the replacement order). By local agreement, the ORC with the RO value may be followed by an order detail segment. \n\nFor example, suppose that an ancillary application were replacing two OBR orders with three different orders. The sequence of segments would be as follows:\n\nSeg\tOrder Control\tComment\nORC\tRU\t1st replaced ORC\nOBR\t\t1st replaced order’s detail segment\n\t\t\nORC\tRU\t2nd replaced ORC\nOBR\t\t2nd replaced order’s detail segment\n\t\t\nORC\tRO\t1st replacement ORC\nOBR\t\t1st replacement order’s detail segment\n\t\t\nORC\tRO\t2nd replacement ORC\nOBR\t\t2nd replacement order’s detail segment\n\t\t\nORC\tRO\t3rd replacement ORC\nOBR\t\t3rd replacement order’s detail segment\n\nWhether the OBR segments must be present is determined by the value of ORC-6-response flag.\n\nThe described replacement method will handle all possible cases of replacement: one into one, many into one, one into many, and many into many. If the placer sent this request to the filler with two RPs, and this was a response back from the filler to the placer, the two RUs (replaced unsolicited) would be two RQs (replaced as requested).
