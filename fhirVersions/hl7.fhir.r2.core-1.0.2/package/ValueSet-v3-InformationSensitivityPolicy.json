For example, an \"employee\" sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   \"Taboo\" would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system\u0027s Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient\u0027s orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy\u0027s criteria directly. The specializable Sensitivity Act.code may be useful in some scenarious if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.","compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode","filter":[{"property":"concept","op":"is-a","value":"_InformationSensitivityPolicy"}]}]}}
