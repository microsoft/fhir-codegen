'abstract' is a property defined by many HL7 code systems that indicates that the concept is a logical grouping concept that is not intended to be used asa 'concrete' concept to in an actual patient/care/process record. This language is borrowed from Object Orienated theory where 'asbtract' objects are never instantiated.
