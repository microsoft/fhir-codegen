Heterozygous indicates the DNA Sequence Variation is only present in one of the two genes contained in homologous chromosomes.

Hemizygous indicates the DNA Sequence Variation exists in the only single copy of a gene in a non- homologous chromosome (the male X and Y chromosome are non-homologous). Hemiplasmic indicates that the DNA Sequence Variation is present in some but not all of the copies of mitochondrial DNA. Homoplasmic indicates that the DNA Sequence Variation is present in all of the copies of mitochondrial DNA. Here is the loinc answer List for Allelic state:1. Heteroplasmic (LA6703-8); 2.
