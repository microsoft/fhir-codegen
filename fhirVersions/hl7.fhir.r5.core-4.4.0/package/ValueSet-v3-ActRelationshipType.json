A reason link is weaker than a trigger, it only suggests that some service may be or might have been a reason for some action, but not that this reason requires/required the action to be taken. Also, as opposed to the trigger, there is no strong timely relation between the reason and the action.

For example, sending a Document act as the result of an imaging observation, sending a list of Procedures and/or other acts as the result of a medical history observation.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        The valueNegationInd attribute on the source Act has the same semantics of &quot;negated finding&quot; when it applies to the target of a VALUE ActRelationship as it does to the value attribute.  On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        \n                           OpenIssue: The implications of negationInd on ActRelationship and the valueNegationind on Observation.\n                  <br/>\n\n                     \n                </td>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>CURE\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActRelationshipType-CURE\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>curative indication</td>\n                <td/>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>CURE.ADJ\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActRelationshipType-CURE.46ADJ\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>adjunct curative indication</td>\n                <td/>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>MTGT.ADJ\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActRelationshipType-MTGT.46ADJ\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td>adjunct mitigation</td>\n                <td/>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>RACT\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActRelationshipType-RACT\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td/>\n                <td/>\n              </tr>\n \n              <tr>\n                <td>1</td>\n                <td>SUGG\n                  <a name=\"v3-ActRelationshipType-SUGG\"> </a>\n                </td>\n                <td/>\n                <td/>\n              </tr>\n\n            </table>\n\n          </div>"},"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-standards-status","valueCode":"external"},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-fmm","valueInteger":0},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-wg","valueCode":"vocab"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActRelationshipType","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.10317"}],"version":"2019-07-31","name":"v3.ActRelationshipType","title":"v3 Code System ActRelationshipType","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2019-07-31","publisher":"HL7, Inc","contact":[{"telecom":[{"system":"url","value":"http://hl7.org"}]}],"description":" The source is an excerpt from the target.","immutable":true,"compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActRelationshipType"}]}}
