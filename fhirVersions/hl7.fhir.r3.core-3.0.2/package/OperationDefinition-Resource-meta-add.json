The meta is updated directly. This is because the content in meta does not affect the meaning of the resource, and the security labels (in particular) are used to apply access rules to existing versions of resources","resource":["Resource"],"system":false,"type":false,"instance":true,"parameter":[{"name":"meta","use":"in","min":1,"max":"1","documentation":"Profiles, tags, and security labels to add to the existing resource.
